This website contains the materials of the labs for the course taught in Innopolis University in 2024.

# Description

The materials are split into three parts. There are materials for labs, project and assignments. The lab materials are the core of the labs and cover new concepts and technologies studied in the lectures and provide examples to guide the student in the assignments. The assignments can be delivered as part of the lab material or as a standalone document. The assignments provide the practical part of the course where exercises are introduced and the student should learn the new topics from the lab materials to solve the assignment tasks. This course includes a capstone project where the students needs to build a big data pipeline. The project materials include the description, grading criteria of the project sections and a standalone material for each stage of the project in which I implement the stages on a toy dataset and the job of the student is to implement them on their selected dataset.
